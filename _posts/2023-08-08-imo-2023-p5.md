Let  $$ n $$  be a positive integer. A Japanese triangle consists of  $$ 1 + 2 + \dots + n $$  circles arranged in an equilateral triangular shape such that for each  $$ i = 1 $$ ,  $$ 2 $$ ,  $$ \dots $$ ,  $$ n $$ , the  $$ i^{th} $$  row contains exactly  $$ i $$  circles, exactly one of which is coloured red. A ninja path in a Japanese triangle is a sequence of  $$ n $$  circles obtained by starting in the top row, then repeatedly going from a circle to one of the two circles immediately below it and finishing in the bottom row. Here is an example of a Japanese triangle with  $$ n = 6 $$ , along with a ninja path in that triangle containing two red circles.

In terms of  $$ n $$ , find the greatest  $$ k $$  such that in each Japanese triangle there is a ninja path containing at least  $$ k $$  red circles.

**Solution 1.** The answer is  $$ \left \lfloor \log_2 n \right \rfloor + 1 $$ . For convenience, we label the rows of the triangle from the top, starting the count from  $$ 1 $$ . For each red circle  $$ A $$ , we assign it a number corresponding to the maximal amount of red circles that can appear in a ninja path from the top of the triangle to  $$ A $$ . We can see that in a Japanese triangle, there is a ninja path with  $$ t $$  red circles iff there is a red circle assigned with the number  $$ t $$ . We are left to find the maximum number  $$ k $$  that can appear in any Japanese triangle.

Claim 1: If  $$ A,B $$  get assigned by the same number  $$ t $$ , then the sub-triangle with  $$ A $$  as the top can not contain  $$ B $$  and vice versa.

Proof: Kinda straightforward. If the sub-triangle with  $$ A $$  as the top contains  $$ B $$ , then there is a ninja path that goes to  $$ A $$ , and then  $$ B $$ , with at least  $$ t+1 $$  red triangles, and  $$ B $$  can not be assigned the number  $$ t $$ .

Claim 2: there are at most  $$ 2^i $$  red circles assigned with the number  $$ i $$ .

Proof: We proceed by induction.  $$ i=1 $$  is trivial. Assume that for any  $$ i \le t $$ , there are at most  $$ 2^i $$  red circles assigned with the number  $$ i $$ . Then, there are at most  $$ 2^{t+1}-1 $$  red circles assigned with a number less than or equal to  $$ t $$ . Hence, there exists a red circle  $$ A $$  assigned with the number  $$ t+1 $$  that lies in a row  $$ h \le 2^{t+1} $$ . By Claim 1, the sub-triangle with  $$ A $$  as the top can not contain any other red circles with the number  $$ t+1 $$ . It also means that there are at most  $$ 2^{t+1}-1 $$  rows either oriented "/" or "\" that can contain a red circle of number  $$ t+1 $$ . By Claim 1 again, each of these rows can have at most one red circle with the number  $$ t+1 $$ . So there can be at most  $$ 2^{t+1} $$  red circles assigned with the number  $$ t+1 $$ , proving the induction.

The rest of the problem should be straightforward. Due to Claim 2, there is always a red circle assigned with the number  $$ \left \lfloor \log_2 n \right \rfloor + 1 $$  in any Japanese triangle with  $$ n $$  rows. Using the similar idea, we can also construct a Japanese triangle where the maximal number assigned to a red circle is  $$ \left \lfloor \log_2 n \right \rfloor + 1 $$ . Hence,  $$ \left \lfloor \log_2 n \right \rfloor + 1 $$  is the maximal number.
 $$ \square $$ 

**Solution 2** Let's denote the circles as  $$ (x,y) $$  - the  $$ y $$ th circle on the  $$ x $$ th row, and let  $$ f(x,y) $$  denote the most red we can visit in a path finishing in  $$ (x,y) $$ . We observe that adding a new row means that  $$ f(x,y) = \max(f(x-1,y-1),f(x-1,y)) $$ , and we need to find the smallest possible value of the largest number on the  $$ n $$ th row.

Claim: On row  $$ 2^z $$ , we have a circle with  $$ f \geq z+1 $$ , and the sum of all  $$ f $$  is at least  $$ z \cdot 2^z + 1 $$ .

We will prove this by induction:

Base:  $$ n=1 $$  and  $$ n=2 $$   $$ \Rightarrow $$  OK

Induction step: WLOG(let the largest  $$ f $$  on row  $$ 2^z $$  be  $$ (2^z,1) $$ ). Adding  $$ 2^z $$  rows means that  $$ f(2^{z+1},i) = z+1 $$ , where  $$ i $$  is from  $$ 1 $$  to  $$ 2^z+1 $$ . (If  $$ f(2^{z+1},i) \geq z+2 $$ , then the induction is done.) The rest have a sum of at least  $$ (z \cdot 2^z - z) + 2^z $$  (We add  $$ 2^z $$  because we have added that many rows, and each row we add, we increase the sum of a  $$ f $$  by  $$ 1 $$  because of a red circle).

But by pigeonhole principle, we have  $$ 2^z-1 $$  numbers with a sum of  $$ (z+1) \cdot 2^z - z = (z+1) \cdot (2^z-1) + 1 $$ , which means at least one circle has  $$ f \geq z+2 $$ . Then, the sum of all the circles on row  $$ 2^{z+1} $$  is at least  $$ (z+1) \cdot (2^z-1) + 1 + (z+1) \cdot (2^z+1) = (z+1) \cdot 2^{z+1} + 1 $$ , which satisfies the induction.

Note: If we ever get  $$ f \geq z+2 $$  earlier, then the same logic applies, and the sum still ends up  $$ \geq (z+1) \cdot 2^{z+1} + 1 $$ .

This means for row  $$ n $$ , we know the answer is  $$ \geq \left\lfloor \log_2(n) \right\rfloor +1 $$ . The example below shows that the answer can't be  $$ \geq \left\lfloor \log_2(n) \right\rfloor +2 $$ , so it's  $$ \boxed{\left\lfloor \log_2(n) \right\rfloor + 1} $$
