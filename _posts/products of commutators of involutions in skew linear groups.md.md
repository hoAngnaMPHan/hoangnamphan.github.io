PRODUCTS OF COMMUTATORS OF INVOLUTIONS IN SKEW LINEAR GROUPS

Abtracts: In connection with Decompositions of matrices over division algebras into products of commutators, Linear Algebra Appl. 646 (2022), 119â€“131. we show that each matrix in the special linear group over a centrally-finite division ring D, in which each element in the first derived subgroup of D is a product of at most s commutators, is a product of at most 3 + 3(\drac{s}{[n/2]} )commutators of involutions in either of the following cases:
(1) $char(D) \neq 2$,
(2) \(charD = 2\) and \( g \geq  3\)
in which [x], (x) denotes the ceiling and floor function of x, respectively. Moreover, in the case of the real quaternion division ring, two is the smallest such number.
