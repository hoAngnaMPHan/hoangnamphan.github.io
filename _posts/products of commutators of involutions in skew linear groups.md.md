PRODUCTS OF COMMUTATORS OF INVOLUTIONS IN SKEW LINEAR GROUPS

Abtracts: In connection with _Decompositions of matrices over division algebras into products of commutators_, Linear Algebra Appl. 646 (2022), 119â€“131. we show that each matrix in the special linear group over a centrally-finite division ring D, in which each element in the first derived subgroup of $D$ is a product of at most $s$ commutators, is a product of at most $3 + 3\left\floor\dfrac{s}{\left\ceil n/2 \right\ceil} \right\floor $ commutators of involutions in either of the following cases:
(1) $char(D) \neq 2$,
(2) $charD = 2$ and $n \geq  3$
in which $\left\ceil x\right\ceil$, $\left\floor x \right\floor$ denotes the ceiling and floor function of $x$, respectively. Moreover, in the case of the real quaternion division ring, two is the smallest such number.
