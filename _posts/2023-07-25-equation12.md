How can we write a formula in file md?

In Markdown files, you can display formulas using LaTeX syntax by enclosing the formula between dollar signs ($). However, not all websites support rendering LaTeX formulas directly, so you might need to use a service that can convert LaTeX to images or MathML for proper display on the website.

Here's how you can write a formula in a Markdown file:

The formula $ x^2+1=0 $ represents a quadratic equation.

If you want to display more complex formulas or equations, you can use double dollar signs ($$) to start and end a block of LaTeX code:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx
$$

To see this formula rendered correctly on a website, you can use an online Markdown editor that supports LaTeX rendering or use an external service like MathJax to render LaTeX math on your website.

For example, when using MathJax, you can include the following script in the head of your HTML file:

<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>

This will enable MathJax to process the LaTeX formulas in your Markdown file and render them correctly on the website.

Remember that the exact implementation may vary depending on the website or platform you are using to display the Markdown content.


Another way to solve this problem, we translate it to svg file. Code: ![equation](https: //latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?equation) do not have the blank

Example: x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}. We write
```
![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}] (https:// latex.codecogs .com/svg.latex?x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a})

```
And the result

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%3D%5Cfrac%7B-b%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bb%5E2-4ac%7D%7D%7B2a%7D)

Test.
